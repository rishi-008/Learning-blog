# Responsively Designed Learning Blog Website
## Problems Faced
- Using CSS Grid to create a responsive website produced the following challenges:
    - The padding for the last CSS Grid element in the CSS Grid wasn't appearing on the screen/ cutting off hence causing the last element's bottom to touch the footer. I figured that the reason for this was because I had set the height of the CSS Grid to 100vh and despite believing that the height of the CSS Grid would be able to contain all the elements, I realized that the solution was to set the height to 80vh or something around that number to account for the footer which occupied a portion of the vh. This was happening because I had assigned the properties of position: fixed;, bottom: 0;, left: 0; to the footer
    - I had set one of the grid items to position: relative and this caused that element to overlap with other elements. This was fixed using grid-template-areas since it manually placed certain elements on the screen.
    - Generally I was confused of when to use CSS Grid vs flexbox. I was curious as to whether all of CSS grid's funcionalities could be achieved via flexbox or if CSS Grid had some special use cases
- Deciding on the scope of the project
    - I initially started this project as a mini project for mainly testing my responsive design skills but slowly as I went through the website, I continued to see opportunities for improvements.
